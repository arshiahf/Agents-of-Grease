Documentation will be separated by file, then by function and relevant variables.

Some core sensibilities in my code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I use the self.global_variable to make a single, easy-to-remember variable to
pass across the life of an object. It offers the functionality of keeping track
of all the normal self variables but in one package that you can just pull in
and reference in each function with "g = self.global_variable" to make a
shorthand reference to it.
I will begin each class that uses self.global_variable with a list of what it
holds in that particular class, for easy reference. If you add more to it when
you find yourself adjusting the class, please update this document.

I use a lot of class inheritance. A lot. I've often found the best way to make
a program is to abstract out as much as you can to a generic parent and just
give particularly specific rules to the furthest down children, like the
self.update() function, which will generally be unique to each final descendent.
If you're going to make something that seems like it could use anything from an
abstract parent I've made, please do, just record in here what direct parent it
has and the hierarchy will build itself.

I mostly use snake_case rather than camelCase when naming variables and files.
I just find it makes it easier to convey information about a variable when you
put its most salient identifying information in its name and separate it like
spaces, which is the convention of snake_case naming. camelCase naming is used
in many languages and is useful, but I just prefer snake_case, especially in
IDEs with auto-complete.

main.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First battery of variables are all generic file paths or specific files.
The rest of the stuff below it is initializing all the different file
related imports and then running the program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


application.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Application class, used to contain the highest level, program controlling
components.

self.global_variable subitems
-------------------------------------
  "screen" -- Holds everything relating to the game window
    "dimensions" -- Dimensions of the window as a tuple
    "center" -- Center coordinates of the window
    "fill_color" -- Neutral fill color of the window
    "window" -- The pygame.display object itself
  "time" -- Holds all time related information for the game
    "clock" -- The pygame.Clock used to keep the ticks going
    "delta_time" -- The moment-to-moment time difference
  "objects" -- Holds all non-player objects, mostly used in collision checking
    "enemies" -- All enemy objects
    "platforms" -- All platform objects
  "error" -- Holds all error-checking data that needs to be retained
    "keys" -- Key related error-checking
      "a" and "d" -- Error data for the a/d movement sticking error
  "done" -- Boolean about whether or not the game has finished
  "sounds" -- Created in pull_sounds, holds all sound objects for the game
  "sprites" -- Created in pull_sprites, holds all sprite objects for the game
    "manager" -- Holds the sprite manager, which contains all sprites for use
  "map" -- Creatd in set_map, holds the game's map variables
    "tilemap" -- Contains the raw JSON/XML data from the actual tilemap file
    "dimensions" -- Holds the dimensions from the tilemap as a tuple
    "image" -- Holds the resulting image from unpacking the tilemap
    "location" -- The map's current absolute location as a tuple, usually (0, 0)
  "player" -- Holds the current instance of the game's player object

Functions
-------------------------------------
__init__
  Initialization function, generates self.global_variable and starts pygame

pull_sounds
  Makes the "sounds" subvariable
  Initialization function, uses folder name passed to import all sounds from
  listed directory

pull_sprites
  Makes the "sprites" subvariable
  Initialization function, uses folder name passed to import all sprites from
  listed directory

set_map
  Makes the "map" subvariable
  Initialization function, uses folder name and file name passed to import a
  specific map file, then uses the folder to access all of the maps relations

make_player
  Makes the "player" subvariable
  Creates the most recent player instance, may be used again to override old
  instance, if necessary.

make_items
  ### For Paige to fill in ###

make_projectile
  ### For Paige to fill in ###

make_platform
  Creates a single platform instance and puts it into "objects"->"platforms"

setup_objects
  Makes the "objects" subvariable
  Initialization funnction, uses passed file name and path to place all objects

get_input
  Runs in update each cycle to check for any input from player of any kind and
  parses it

draw
  Draws all objects, players, and the map each cycle

update
  Gets the current tick, calls draw and get_input, and performs various
  maintaining functions to keep the program running

run
  Makes the player, gets the first tick, runs the game, then shuts it all down
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


generic_object.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract class meant for most objects to inherit from.

self.global_variable subitems
-------------------------------------
"position" -- Holds the object's current position
"movement" -- Holds all variables related to changing the object's position
  "speed" -- The objects current rate of changing its position
  "physics_type" -- How the object interacts with gravity and other physics
                    objects. Options are dynamic, static, and kinematic
  "gravity_base" -- The object's core gravity value for when it's not on a
                    static object
  "gravity" -- The object's current gravity, mostly changes between base and 0
"sprite" -- Holds the current Sprite object used to represent the object
"frame" -- The current frame the sprite is on. Start's at -1 because update
            methods generally start by incrementing frame

Functions
-------------------------------------
pos
  Inherent property that is used to return and adjust the object's position

spr
  Inherent property that is used to return the object's sprite

phys_type
  Inherent property that is used to return the object's physics type

has_grav
  Returns a boolean value expressing whether or not the object is currently
  affected by its base gravity value

distance
  Takes another object's position as an argument, calculates current object's
  distance to the other object

direction
  Takes a vector as an argument, usually another object's position. Calculates
  the direction towards the other vector

speed_vector
  Takes a vector as an argument, usually another object's position. Returns a
  unit vector aimed at said vector

travel
  Takes a vector as an argument, usually another object's position, amd a speed
  value. Creates a unit vector aimed at said vector and moves the object towards
  the other vector

animate
  Takes the desired animation, the surface to be blitted on, the direction the
  animation will face, and whether or not the animation will ever change, a.k.a.
  if it is a static animation, as arguments. Searches the object's sprite for
  the desired animation and blits it to the given surface if it is valid. The
  Sprite class will throw an error if the animation is invalid
